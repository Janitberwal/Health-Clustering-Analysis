# Health-Clustering-Analysis
I applied unsupervised machine learning techniques â€” K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering â€” to group individuals based on various health-related features.
Using a cleaned dataset with features such as blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, glucose, heart rate, and age, I performed dimensionality reduction using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to visualize high-dimensional data in 2D.

ðŸ§ª K-Means Clustering: Divided the data into k distinct groups based on Euclidean distance.

ðŸ§¬ Agglomerative Clustering: Used hierarchical clustering to group similar individuals using a bottom-up approach.

ðŸ“‰ PCA: Helped reduce feature space and enabled visual inspection of clusters.

ðŸ§© Cluster Visualization: Created intuitive scatter plots showing clear group separation.

ðŸ§ª Optional Evaluation (if you added silhouette score): Measured clustering effectiveness using the silhouette score.
